# Question: How do you perform deep equality checking between two objects or structs? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided defines a function named `deepEqual` that performs a deep equality check between two objects. The function first checks if the two objects are strictly equal, returning true if they are. If not, it checks if either object is not an object or is null, returning false in either case. It then retrieves the keys of both objects and checks if they have the same number of keys, returning false if they do not. The function then iterates over the keys of the first object, checking if the second object has the same key and if the values associated with the key in both objects are deeply equal, using a recursive call to `deepEqual`. If the second object does not have the same key or the values are not deeply equal, the function returns false. If all checks pass, the function returns true, indicating that the two objects are deeply equal. The function is then tested with two pairs of objects, with the results printed to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is almost identical to the JavaScript version. The only difference is that TypeScript version includes type annotations for the parameters of the `deepEqual` function. In TypeScript, `obj1: any` and `obj2: any` are used to specify that `obj1` and `obj2` can be of any type. This is a feature of TypeScript that allows for static type checking, which can help catch type-related errors at compile time.

The logic of the `deepEqual` function remains the same in both versions. It first checks if the two objects are the same reference or if they are both null or not objects. If not, it gets the keys of both objects and checks if they have the same number of keys. If they do, it iterates over the keys of the first object and checks if the second object has the same key and if the values for that key are deeply equal by recursively calling the `deepEqual` function. If all checks pass, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

The test cases in both versions are also similar, but the TypeScript version tests with three objects instead of two pairs of objects. The results of the tests are printed to the console in both versions.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution is quite different from the JavaScript version due to the differences in the languages themselves.

In the JavaScript version, the `deepEqual` function checks if the two objects are the same object (`obj1 === obj2`), if they are not objects or are null, and if they have the same number of keys. It then checks if all keys in the first object are in the second object and if the values for these keys are the same in both objects. This is done recursively to handle nested objects, hence the term "deep" equality.

The C++ version, on the other hand, is much simpler because it's dealing with structs, not objects. Structs in C++ are a way of grouping related data together, but they don't have methods or behaviors like JavaScript objects do. The `isEqual` function in the C++ version simply checks if the corresponding fields in the two structs are equal. There's no need for recursion because structs can't contain nested structs in the same way that JavaScript objects can contain nested objects.

In terms of language features, the JavaScript version uses features like `typeof`, `null`, `Object.keys`, and `Array.includes`, which don't have direct equivalents in C++. The C++ version uses features like structs and references (`const MyStruct& obj1`) that don't have direct equivalents in JavaScript.

In terms of methods, the JavaScript version uses a recursive method to perform deep equality checking, while the C++ version uses a simple comparison of struct fields. The JavaScript version also uses the `console.log` method to print the results, while the C++ version uses `std::cout`.
